      question: "What are the fees for programmes? And are payments flexible?",
      answer: `
        <p>
          We believe in making quality education accessible. There is no
          application fee! A one-time registration fee of $50 is payable upon
          enrollment. Your tuition fee is calculated per module based on its
          credit load. Each credit is charged at an affordable rate of $13 for
          undergraduate programmes and $19.50 for postgraduate programmes.
        </p></br>
        <p>If you opt for a full-time load of 60 credits in a semester for an undergraduate programme, your total fee for that semester would be (60 credits x $13 per credit) $780. To further support your financial planning, we offer a highly flexible payment structure, allowing you to pay undergraduate fees in six convenient monthly instalments of $130.</p></br>
        <p>If you opt for a full-time load of 60 credits in a semester for a postgraduate programme, your total fee for that semester would be (60 credits x $19.50 per credit) $1170. Here too we offer a highly flexible payment structure, allowing you to pay postgraduate fees in six convenient monthly instalments of $195.</p></br>
