      question: "What are the fees for programmes? And are payments flexible?",
      answer: `
        <p>
We believe in making quality education accessible. There is no application fee! A one-time registration fee of $50 is payable upon enrollment. Your tuition fee is calculated per module based on its credit load. Each credit is charged at an affordable rate of $13 for undergraduate programmes and $19.50 for postgraduate programmes.
</br></br>
If you opt for a full-time load of 60 credits in a semester for an undergraduate programme, your total fee for that semester would be (60 credits x $13 per credit) $780. To further support your financial planning, we offer a highly flexible payment structure, allowing you to pay undergraduate fees in six convenient monthly instalments of $130.
</br></br>
If you opt for a full-time load of 60 credits in a semester for a postgraduate programme, your total fee for that semester would be (60 credits x $19.50 per credit) $1170. Here too, we offer a highly flexible payment structure, allowing you to pay postgraduate fees in six convenient monthly instalments of $195.
